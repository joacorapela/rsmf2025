We are currently using the measures described below to assess the impact of
Bonsai in the experimental neuroscience and/or methods development community.
We will compare the change of these measures before and after each project
milestone is achieved.

\begin{description}

    \item[Bonsai.ML nuget package downloads:] we monitor the number of
    Bonsai.ML package downloads at
    \url{https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bonsai.ML},

    \item[Number of Bonsai packages integrated into Bonsai.ML:] we use
    nuget.org to check the number of packages that are using Bonsai.ML at
    \url{https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bonsai.ML}, which is a proxy to the
    number of methods developers contributing to Bonsai.ML.

    \item[Bonsai.ML discussions in Bonsai forum:] we track discussions in the
    Bonsai forum that are related to Bonsai.ML (e.g.,
    \url{https://github.com/orgs/bonsai-rx/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+bonsai.ml}.

    \item[Usage of \url{https://github.com/bonsai-rx/machinelearning}:] we
    observe the stars/watching/clones of this repository
