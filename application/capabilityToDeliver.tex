This proposal was prepared by the senior RSE, JR, who cannot be project lead of
this proposal due to UCL policies.

\subsection*{Highly trained RSEs in }

Acquiring domain expertise is essential for the work of RSEs. Ideally, RSEs
are well trained in the domain area of their collaborating scientists, and
attend their research talks. However, in standard university RSE groups, where
RSEs work with scientists in many domain areas, acquiring this domain expertise
is very challenging.

Fortunately, at the SWC and Gatsby Unit, RSEs are deeply integrated into the
machine learning and neuroscience research of their collaborating scientists,
they attend their research talks, and interact closely with them.  Hence, our
RSEs are highly trained in machine learning and neuroscience, skills that are
central for the successful delivery of this proposal.
