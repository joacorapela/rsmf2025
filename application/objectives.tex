\paragraph{Documentation and Training} Most Bonsai users are not highly skilled
in ML. We aim at creating extensive documentation and use cases, and delivering
Bonsai curses, so that users can well understand Bonsai.ML tools, realize their
power, and use them correctly and effectively to address their research goals.

\paragraph{Community Building} Our experience with Bonsai shows that excellent
functionality and documentation alone are not enough--active engagement with the
community is essential for adoption. We aim at doing this in two ways: (1) by
continuing the Bonsai developers conference, first held in 2024 with over 30
leading neuroscientists and planned again for 2026; and (2) by showcasing
Bonsai.MLâ€™s impact through collaborations with experimental neuroscientists at
top research centers worldwide.

\paragraph{Integrations} Excellent ML packages exist in the open-source
community that could greatly benefit Bonsai users, and streamline
inference code, if integrated into Bonsai.ML. We aim at integrating a few of
these packages into Bonsai.ML.

\paragraph{Governance} World-class neuroscientists around the world are heavily
invested in Bonsai. They all want Bonsai to advance for their own benefit and
the benefit of the community. We aim at building a steering committee that will
advice us on the progress of the project and on building a long-term Bonsai.ML
roadmap.
