\subsection{Approach}

\subsubsection{Aim 1: Documentation}

Background: The Bonsai.ML project has maintained a strong commitment to producing high-quality documentation to support both experimental neuroscience users and machine learning method developers. The documentation of the current Bonsai.ML project includes a few articles introducing the packages with installation guides for each package, an automatically generated API reference for the C\# codebase, and some examples demonstrating various use cases. Currently, there is no documentation for the Python code integrated into the packages, nor are there any video tutorials or developer-focused documentation.

Our team has been approached by several users of the package who have expressed concerns about the current state of the documentation, particularly regarding the documentation structure. There is redundancy in places in the documentation and a lack of clarity in others. For instance, the installation instructions for Bonsai.ML.LinearDynamicalSystems is included in the "Getting Started" section of the Linear Dynamical Systems examples. Additionally, these instructions are very similar to those found in other Bonsai.ML - Python based packages, leading to additional redundancy. Conversely, the current documentation lacks critical statistical information in several parts, including packages implementing specific machine learning models, and examples (both with simulated data and real-world data). This lack of clarity and redundancy has made it difficult for users to find the information they need, leading to unnecessary user-friction driving new users away from the project.

Furthermore, the current documentation does not adequately address the needs of machine learning method developers. Our team has documented several approaches for integrating machine learning models into Bonsai, but this information is currently distributed across various sources, including GitHub repos, discussion issues, pull requests, and examples. Our project lacks a dedicated, centralized resource that provides comprehensive documentation for method developers looking to create new machine learning functionality in Bonsai using the approaches our team has developed.

To address these issues, we have identified several key areas of improvement that we believe will enhance the usability and accessibility of the documentation for both user groups. These include:

* Restructure and expand the existing documentation to match the style of established machine learning libraries. For this, our team will base our documentation style on the popular scikit-learn documentation. We will add to Bonsai.ML's documentation by creating dedicated sections for installation, user guides, detailed statistical explanations of methods, API reference, examples, and troubleshooting.
* Provide additional tailored, comprehensive examples and user guides to demonstrate applications of Bonsai.ML methods for both neuroscientists and machine learning developers.
* Produce video tutorials to complement written documentation, catering to different learning styles and improving accessibility.
* Enhance developer-focused documentation, including detailed guides and tutorials for method developers on how to create and integrate new machine learning methods into Bonsai using 3 different approaches: Python, C\# scripting, and TorchSharp.


\paragraph{Tasks:}\mbox{}\\

\begin{description}

    \item[doc\_review:] Conduct a thorough review of the existing documentation (Python, C\#, and TorchSharp). Identify redundancies, outdated content, missing sections compared to scikit-learn package.

    \item[doc\_style\_guide:] Create a Bonsai.ML style guide which will include conventions for: documentation, code formatting, naming, and video tutorial format. These will draw on inspirations from the style guides and best practices put forth by \href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions}{Microsoft}, the \href{https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md}{dotnet community}, and the developers of \href{https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md}{PyTorch}.
    
    \item[doc\_examples\_improvement:] Improve the existing examples by restructuring them to match the new style guide. Each example will include a detailed explanation of the Bonsai workflow, the mathematical/statistical basis of the model, and clarifications on assumptions and data requirements.

    \item[doc\_examples\_new:] Develop at least 3 new examples that showcase complete applications of Bonsai.ML. These examples will cover: neural signal processing, real-time latent visualization, and clustering of behavioural data. Each example will have detailed workflow descriptions, information on the models and assumptions, and explanations of the datasets.

    \item[doc\_user\_guides:] Write new, comprehensive user guides to teach users about key ML concepts and how to use the Bonsai.ML libraries correctly. User guides will come in 2 flavours: one will be geared towards neuroscientists who may have familiarity with conducting experiments but are less familiar with ML techniques. These will focus more on teaching core concepts of math, statistics, and machine learning. The other style will be geared more towards ML developers and will focus more on reactive, online data streams and approaches for integrating ML models into Bonsai. These user guides will include how to create a new Bonsai.ML package with Python, C\# and expression scripting, and integrating models via TorchSharp and other native C\# libraries.
    
    \item[doc\_troubleshooting:] Create a troubleshooting section to address common issues users may encounter when using Bonsai.ML packages. This section will include solutions to frequently asked questions, common errors, and tips for debugging.
    
    \item[doc\_videos:] Produce at least 3 video tutorials and demos, hosted on YouTube, and embed them directly into the documentation. These videos will cover key topics such as installation, user guides, and examples. The 3 videos will be: 1) Installation and getting started with Bonsai.ML, 2) Integrating custom models into Bonsai using Python, C\#, and TorchSharp, and 3) Building a Bonsai.ML application to perform closed-loop stimulation using online neural signal processing.

\end{description}

\paragraph{Impact:}
Improving the documentation of Bonsai.ML will directly improve the code's maintainability, reduce technical debt for maintainers and contributors, and expand the project's reach. The expansion of the documentation will also greatly enhance usability of Bonsai.ML for two core communities: experimental neuroscientists and machine learning developers. Clearer, better-structured resources aimed at these groups will reduce barriers to usage and onboarding friction. Specifically, we will provide experimental neuroscientists with the knowledge to adopt and implement powerful ML tools for real-time experimental applications. Additionally, we will provide ML developers interested in integrating their models into Bonsai with the guidance from experienced, Bonsai.ML developers, to extend ML functionality in Bonsai. By adding examples, comprehensive user guides, troubleshooting resources, and video tutorials, we will create robust, easy-to-navigate documentation, modeled after leading ML libraries, that will greatly boost Bonsai.ML's maintenance and adoption. Ultimately, these improvements will lower duplication of effort, standardize best practices, broaden Bonsai.ML's reach, and ensure long-term sustainability through a stronger and more engaged user and developer community.

\subsubsection{Aim 3: Maintainability}

\paragraph{Summary:} Simplify and homogenise inference and learning code, and streamline the addition of new probabilistic models to Bonsai.ML.

\paragraph{Background:} Most of the probabilistic models currently integrated
into Bonsai are implemented in Python. These serve as excellent demonstrations
of how Python applications can connect to the Bonsai ecosystem, and they are
central to our aim of attracting Python developers to contribute to Bonsai.ML.
%
However, Python implementations are substantially slower than equivalent C\#
code. For demanding real-time applications, C\# implementations are preferable,
especially when expressed in a probabilistic programming language (PPL).

In addition, the existing Python and C\# implementations of probabilistic
models (e.g., linear dynamical systems, hidden Markov models, Bayesian linear
regression — see
\href{https://bonsai-rx.org/machinelearning/examples/README.html}{examples})
are relatively complex and heterogeneous, in the sense that the implementation
of learning and inference in linear dynamical systems is non-trivial and has
little in common with the implementation of learning and inference in Bayesian
linear regression or in hidden Markov models.
%
In contrast, implementations in a C\# PPL would be much simpler, since PPLs
abstract from their users the complexities of their inference algorithms,
leading to sophisticated inferential methods implemented in a few lines of
code.
%
Also, thanks to this abstraction, implementations of different probabilistic
models in PPLs are substantially more homogeneous in PPLs than in general
purpose ones.

Currently, when we decide to incorporate a new probabilistic model into
Bonsai.ML, we need to implement the learning and inference algorithms for the
specific model, which is generally quite complex and time consuming.
%
In contrast, implementing a new probabilistic model in a PPL only requires the
specification of how the model generates observations, without the
need of specific learning or inference algorithms.
%
Thus, integrating a PPL into Bonsai.ML would greatly simplify the addition of
new probabilistic models to the language.

Fortunately, C\# has an excellent PPL:
\href{https://dotnet.github.io/infer/}{Infer.NET}, developed at Microsoft
Research Cambridge since 2004, used in
\href{https://dotnet.github.io/infer/papers.html}{hundreds of papers}, and
\href{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/the-microsoft-infer-net-machine-learning-framework-goes-open-source/}{open-sourced
in 2018}.  Infer.NET uses deterministic approximate inference, enabling fast
and scalable solutions. For
\href{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/the-microsoft-infer-net-machine-learning-framework-goes-open-source/}{example},
it has powered systems that extract knowledge from billions of web pages
(petabyte-scale data) — the kind of scalability critical for real-time
inference in Bonsai.

\paragraph{Previous work:} Our Microsoft collaborator, Dr.~Tom Minka, invented
a seminal algorithm for inference in graphical models, the Expectation
Propagation algorithm~\citep{minka01}, and is the lead developer of Infer.NET.
Please refer to his letter of support.

\paragraph{Tasks:}\mbox{}\\

\begin{description}

    \item[in\_learn:] the responsible team member is skilled in probabilistic
        programming, but not in Infer.NET. He will invest two weeks in learning
        well the language.

    \item[in\_OBLR:]  Implement in Infer.NET the Online Bayesian Linear
        Regression model, currently implemented in C\# in Bonsai.ML. Develop
        test cases to check that the output of the Infer.Net and previous C\#
        implementations are equal.

    \item[in\_LDS:] Implement in Infer.NET the Linear Dynamical Systems model,
        currently implemented in Python. Develop test cases to check that the
        output of the Infer.Net and previous Python implementations are equal.

    \item[in\_HMM:] Implement in Infer.NET the Hidden Markov Model, currently
        implemented in Python. Develop test cases to check that the output of
        the Infer.Net and previous Python implementations are equal.

    \item[in\_PPdecoder:] Implement in Infer.NET the Point Process Decoding
        model, currently implemented in Python. Develop test cases to check
        that the output of the Infer.Net and previous Python implementations
        are equal.

    \item[in\_docs:] For each of the models integrated above, we will add
        extensive documentation explaining how the models were implemented in
        Infer.NET. The aim is to enable Bonsai.ML users to learn from these
        examples and apply the same principles to build and perform inference
        on their own custom probabilistic models, beyond the ones provided in
        Bonsai.ML-Infer.NET.

\end{description}

\paragraph{Impact:}
This integration will accelerate
inference, simplify and standardise inference programs, and empower Bonsai
users to create new probabilistic models and inference algorithms with just a
few lines of code. Consequently, this activity will drastically improve the
maintainability of the software and facilitate the incorporation of new
probabilistic functionality to the Bonsai ecosystem.

\subsubsection{Aim 4: Community reach}

\paragraph{Summary:} Attract to Bonsai scientists interested in close-loop
control of neural activity by integrating functionality from
the \href{https://cloctools.github.io/}{CLOCTools} software into Bonsai.ML.

\paragraph{Background:} Closed-loop neural control represents a transformative
advance in neuroscience:  rather than delivering stimulation at fixed,
open-loop schedules, it enables precisely timed interventions based on ongoing
brain and behavioural activity. This paradigm allows researchers to move beyond
observing correlations to  directly testing causal mechanisms of neural
dynamics, plasticity, and behaviour. Critically, closed-loop stimulation has
already proved transformative in the  clinic, for example in deep brain
stimulation for Parkinson’s disease and  epilepsy, while its extension to other
disorders (e.g. depression, obsessive  compulsive disorder) remains an active
area of research. Despite this promise, widespread adoption has been limited
by the lack of accessible, well-engineered,  and sustainable software
frameworks for real-time experimental control.

Prof.~Garrett Stanley (Georgia Tech and Emory University, US) is a pioneer in
closed-loop neuroscience, having developed groundbreaking methods that combine
real-time neural control with systems neuroscience. He recently contacted us to
explore integrating their existing
\href{https://cloctools.github.io/}{CLOCTools}, originally implemented in
RTXI/C++, into Bonsai.ML.  This represents a unique opportunity: Bonsai already
excels at real-time closed-loop control in behavioural experiments, and
extending it to include state-of-the-art closed-loop neural control will
position the platform as the first sustainable, general-purpose framework for
both levels of experimentation.

An important reason for the poor uptake of closed-loop methods in neuroscience
could be that existing implementations are often ad hoc, difficult to install
or  extend, and not integrated with software for experimental control. By
providing Bonsai users with accessible, open-source, and sustainably engineered
tools for closed-loop control, we will directly address this barrier and enable
a new type of experimentation where researchers can both read and write the
neural code in real time. This will accelerate discovery across both basic and
translational neuroscience.

\paragraph{Previous work:} Members of Prof.~Stanley’s lab have already
prototyped some of their closed-loop control methods in Bonsai using our
\href{https://bonsai-rx.org/python-scripting/}{Python scripting interface}.
Please refer to the repositories in the
\href{https://github.com/ndac-bonsai}{ndcac-bonsai} organisation containing
these prototypes (ndac stands for neural dynamic adaptive control).

\subsection{Management}

We will conduct management activities at different frequencies:

\begin{description}

    \item[Twice a year:] we will convene the steering committee. Two weeks in
        advance of each meeting, we will circulate a progress report
        summarising achieved milestones, proposed future activities, and the
        most recent version of the Bonsai.ML long-term roadmap.

        milestones, and provide feedback or suggestions on planned activities.
        %
        Based on project progress and committee input, we will revise the
        long-term roadmap, ensuring that Bonsai.ML development remains aligned
        with community needs and strategic goals.
        %
        Minutes and key decisions from these meetings will be documented and,
        where possible, shared with the Research Software Maintenance Fund
        through appropriate reporting channels.

    \item[Every month:] we will hold meetings between the project lead, the
        project co-lead, the RSE, and the external project co-lead, to evaluate
        the project progress.
