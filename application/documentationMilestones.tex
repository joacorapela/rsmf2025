These are the milestones I can think for the documentation section:

## Improve current documentation

- documentation re-structured following scikit-learn style
- additional examples of the application of Bonsai.ML methods
- be specific about which examples we will provide

## Video tutorials

- video tutorial included in documentation

## Documentation for method developers

- Python scripting documentation improved
- C# scripting documentation improved
- documentation on TorchSharp functionality available in Bonsai improved

## Bonsai.ML Paper

- preprint published on BioRxiv

## Training

- Bonsai course announced
- Bonsai course delivered

While thinking on milestones for the collaboration with Garrett, I
realised that it will take much longer than what I previously thought.
See estimates below. Only integrating neurostate-hmm will take around
six months.

# Neural Dynamic Adaptive Control tools

- implement subset of ssm library in C# (4 weeks)
- implement neurostate-hmm in C# (2 weeks)
- develop test cases of neurostate-hmm and fix problems (3 weeks)
- integrate neurostate-hmm into Bonsai (2 weeks)
- add functionality to Bonsai to replay previously recorded data (2 weeks)
- evaluate Bonsai's neurostate-hmm with replayed data (2 weeks)
- evaluate and improve latency of neurostate-hmm in Bonsai (2 weeks)
- collaborate with Prof.~Stanley lab in testing neurostate-hmm in real-time experimental data (2 weeks)
- add documentation on neurostate-hmm in Bonsai (2 weeks)
- add tutorials on neurostate-hmm in Bonsai (2 weeks)
- release the neurostate-hmm Bonsai package (2 weeks)

- implement HybridSystemControl in C#
- develop test cases of HybridSystemControl
- integrate HybridSystemControl into Bonsai
- evaluate Bonsai's HybridSystemControl with replayed data
- evaluate and improve latency of HybridSystemControl in Bonsai
- collaborate with Prof.~Stanley lab in testing HybridSystemControl in real-time experimental data
- add documentation on HybridSystemControl in Bonsai
- add tutorials on HybridSystemControl in Bonsai
- release the HybridSystemControl Bonsai package
