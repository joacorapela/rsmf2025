More than a decade ago, Dr.~Gonçalo Lopes created \href{https://bonsai-rx.org/}{Bonsai}, a reactive visual programming language for neuroscience experiment control. Today, Bonsai has become the most widely used tool of its kind, adopted by thousands of laboratories worldwide, with over 7,000 downloads annually and nearly 100 citations per year of the core Bonsai paper~\citep{lopesEtAl15}. It has already transformed experimental design by enabling studies of a complexity previously unimaginable.

In 2022, we recognised that integrating machine learning (ML) into Bonsai could enable a new generation of intelligent experimental control. With BBSRC support, we developed \href{https://bonsai-rx.org/machinelearning}{Bonsai.ML}, a package that seamlessly incorporates advanced ML functionality into the Bonsai ecosystem.

Our proposal will accelerate the uptake and impact of Bonsai.ML through complementary strategies. First, we will provide high-quality ML methods, supported by comprehensive documentation, training, and dissemination. This will empower experimental neuroscientists to explore and identify “killer applications” independently. Second, we will collaborate directly with neuroscientists to address specific research challenges, demonstrating Bonsai.ML’s transformative potential through real-world case studies. This interdisciplinary effort leverages our unique expertise in software engineering, ML, and experimental neuroscience.

Community engagement will be central to success. A Bonsai developers conference and targeted community-building activities will consolidate and expand the user base, while training courses and dissemination will promote best practices in sustainable software development. The integration of a C\# probabilistic programming language will simplify and unify inference and learning code, improving maintainability and enabling scalable online learning. Finally, an international steering committee will guide research priorities, oversee development, and help establish a long-term roadmap, ensuring sustainability.

With Bonsai.ML, we aim to spark a second revolution in experimental neuroscience— empowering researchers to design adaptive, intelligent experiments that were previously beyond imagination.
