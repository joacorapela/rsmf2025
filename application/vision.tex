More than ten years ago our business partner, Dr.~Goncalo Lopes, created
\href{https://bonsai-rx.org/}{Bonsai}, a reactive visual programming
language most widely used for neuroscience experiment control.

Bonsai has been adopted by thousands of users in the UK and all around the
world (7,000 downloads per year and 1,000 citations per year of the core Bonsai
paper~\citep{lopesEtAl15}).

In 2022, we recognized that integrating ML into the Bonsai platform could
enable a radically new form of intelligent experimental control.

To realise this vision, sponsored by
\href{https://gow.bbsrc.ukri.org/grants/AwardDetails.aspx?FundingReference=BB\%2FW019132\%2F1}{BBSRC},
we developed \href{https://bonsai-rx.org/machinelearning}{Bonsai.ML}, a package
that brings ML functionality into the Bonsai ecosystem.

Bonsai.ML aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge machine learning and
experimental neuroscience by providing accessible tools that help researchers
integrate ML into their workflows and advance our understanding of brain
function.

The proposed documentation, training and dissemination activities will help
users of Bonsai.ML better understand the ML methods in the package, perform
more sophisticated neuroscience experiments, and produce unprecedented new
neuroscientific findings.

The proposed integration activities will equip Bonsai.ML with state-of-the-art
methods for closed-loop control of neural activity, while adding a
probabilistic programming language to the Bonsai ecosystem that will
accelerate, standardize, and simplify inference, resulting in more reliable,
less error-prone, and easier-to-maintain code.

These activities will attract to Bonsai new experimental neuroscience users
interested in adding ML functionality to their experiments, and create a new
Bonsai community of ML methods developers interested in applying their methods
in close loop to the real-time data generated by Bonsai.

Bonsai has already transformed experimental design, allowing researchers to
perform studies of complexity previously unimaginable. With Bonsai.ML, we aim
to spark a second revolution â€” empowering scientists to control experiments in
intelligent, adaptive ways they had never thought possible. The activities
proposed here are critical to achieve this goal.
