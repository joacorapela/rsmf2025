More than ten years ago our business partner, Dr.~Goncalo Lopes, created
\href{https://bonsai-rx.org/}{Bonsai}, a reactive visual programming
language most widely used for neuroscience experiment control.
%
Bonsai has been adopted by thousands of users in the UK and all around the
world (7,000 downloads per year and almost 100 citations per year of the core Bonsai
paper~\citep{lopesEtAl15}).

In 2022, we recognized that integrating ML into the Bonsai platform could
enable a radically new form of intelligent experimental control.
%
To realise this vision, sponsored by
\href{https://gow.bbsrc.ukri.org/grants/AwardDetails.aspx?FundingReference=BB\%2FW019132\%2F1}{BBSRC},
we developed \href{https://bonsai-rx.org/machinelearning}{Bonsai.ML}, a collection of packages
that bring ML functionality into the Bonsai ecosystem.

\textbf{We are searching for Bonsai.ML applications that will demonstrate its
transformative impact.}
%
One possible path is to provide high-quality machine learning methods, write
excellent and comprehensive documentation, disseminate the package broadly, and
foster a strong community—allowing experimental neuroscientists themselves to
discover “killer applications.”
%
A complementary path is to collaborate directly with experimental
neuroscientists, working hand-in-hand to address their research questions and
jointly uncover compelling Bonsai.ML applications.
%
The activities proposed below are designed to pursue both of these paths in
parallel.

The proposed documentation, training and dissemination activities will empower
users of Bonsai.ML to produce unprecedented new neuroscientific findings. The
proposed integration activities will equip Bonsai.ML with precious new
functionality, while adding a probabilistic programming language that will
standardize and simplify inference, resulting in less error-prone and
easier-to-maintain code.
%
These activities will attract new experimental neuroscience users to Bonsai and
create a new Bonsai community of ML methods developers interested in applying
their methods in close loop to the real-time data generated by Bonsai.

Bonsai has already transformed the way neuroscientists design and conduct their experiments, allowing researchers to study complex neuroscientific questions previously unimaginable. With Bonsai.ML, we aim
to spark a new revolution — empowering scientists to control experiments in
intelligent, adaptive ways they had never thought possible.
